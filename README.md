# SushiSwap POAP Design - Forum AMA
## Concept
The neon Sushi logo is iconic, perfectly suited to serve as the base for the design of the POAP. Neon signage seem to signal "underground" yet "inviting", which just felt perfect for a community AMA.

## Usage
Combine ``blank.png`` with images found in ``numbers`` directory to create POAPs for each episode!
